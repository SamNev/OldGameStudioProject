	can cover Y doing Z if they fall ill.
	Conclusions:
		"Summarise the goal of the project"
		Comparisons to other projects- is the scope here feasable? What might we 			NOT be able to do here? What could be designed better?
		Assuming we get everything in this specification done with a month left. 			What's next?
		Next steps from now! What's the plan? talk about connor maybe making a 			basic testing level, paul doing assets and animation, dan getting started on 			making cubes that will be enemies doing various shit, charlie something 			something land mines etc.
	Sign off report, and references if we have them, then we can put this shit to rest and 	get on with making the bloody game already
